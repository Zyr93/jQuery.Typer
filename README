jQuery.Typer
================

The "Typer" plugin for jQuery creates a visual text editor in any element which you may fully customize
by specifying buttons and automatic text replacers to, for example, wrap certain keywords in a <span> tag
highlighting the text.

I created this project in my need of something fully styleable as Google Chrome usually adds ugly yellow
borders around focused text input fields. Just to make it uniform on every browser like jUI does, I've
created this plugin designed to appear just like a standard text input element featuring a caret and
selection.

If using on existing text input elements such as input with type = text or textarea, the plugin will not
break the formula functionality, meaning you could still simply send the request without doing anything
special in JavaScript.
For password fields, the input will be masked with asterisks ("*").

As of version 0.0.1, I am only half way done. The rest of the features still have some time to wait as I
currently am in a hussle to get the current main project done. Once I find myself having some more time,
I'll really implement the remaining configurative features.
